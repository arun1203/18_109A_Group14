        <h2>Lending Club Project</h2>
		<h4>Group 14: Milestone 3</h4>
        <section>
            <h3>Project Background</h3>
            <p>LendingClub is a peer-to-peer lending network that launched in 2006. It provides a marketplace that allows potential borrowers to apply for loans. Investors can review these applications and decide how much they are willing to fund - either manually or through an automated strategy. To facilitate this evaluation, LendingClub provides data on the borrower that can be used to determine investment decisions. 
			</p>
			<p>The first part of the project is to build a model that can be used to inform an investment strategy, which could be used by a LendingClub investor. The research question we have proposed for this part is: Given a loan application, our model will predict whether the applicant will 'pay-off' or 'charge-off' the loan.
            </p>
			<p>
			The second part of the project is to investigate potential issues of discrimination. LendingClub requires that its investors commit to not violating borrower discrimination laws. Thus, it is not permitted to use characteristics such as race, sex, religion etc when deciding whether or not to invest in loans. Although the information reported does not contain demographic information that would allow for direct consideration of these factors, there are other variables that could be used to infer an applicant’s social characteristics, such as their location (correlating with race) or years of employment (correlating with age).  Our proposed approach to this second part of the project is based on a literature review and explained further below.

            <h3>Description of the data and initial cleaning</h3>
            <p>LendingClub provides two datasets: Loan data (for all loans issued) and Declined loan data (loan applications that did not meet LendingClub’s credit underwriting policy.
            </p>
			<p>The Loan data covers the period from 2007 to Q2 2018. It contains around 150 variables, details of which are provided in a data dictionary. 
			</p>
			<p>The Declined loan data covers the same period; however, it only contains nine predictors and refers to applications that do not make it onto the LendingClub platform. This data is therefore not considered relevant to the research question, since investors would not consider these applicants in their strategies. 
			</p>
			<p>We have elected to focus on the data for 2016 and 2017 for the purposes of training the model. This is because:
			<ul>
			<li>The variables included in the datasets have changed over time, meaning that features in the more recent datasets are not necessarily available in the older datasets.</li>
			<li>Since the model will be used to inform an investment strategy going forwards, the most relevant data are from recent years.</li>
			</ul>
			</p>

        <h3>Data Resources</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Loan Data: These files contain complete loan data for all loans issued through the time period stated,including the current loan status (Current, Late, Fully Paid, etc.) and latest payment information.
                The file containing loan data through the “present“ contains complete loan data for all loans issued through the previous completed calendar quarter.
			</li>
            <li>Declined Loan Data: These files contain the list and details of all loan applications that did not meet Lending Club’s credit underwriting policy.</li>

		<h3>High Level Project Goals</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Create a model (or models) to power your investment strategy.</li>
            <li>Using your model(s), explain your strategy. What are the key variables driving your investment decisions?</li>
            <li>Using your investment strategy, how what kind of return are you expecting?</li>
			<li>Evaluate the predictive quality of your model(s).</li>
			<li>Address the ethical implications of your model along the lines of fairness and discrimination.What are possible unintended effects of your model? What types of loan recipients would be advantaged or disadvantaged in your model? Are there ways you can quantify the fairness or disparities produced by your model?</li>
